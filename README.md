## Hi, I'm Alastair

<hr>

### In a nutshell:

- Just about to make the leap to full-stack developer after nearly 9 years as a self-employed personal trainer üèãüèº
- As of **11/05/2021** I'm sadly closing down my personal training business and actively hunting for my first junior developer role üíª
- Just completed the [Code Institute Diploma](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/) in full-stack software development and awaiting my final grade ü§ûüèº
- Why did I want to make the switch to software development? Four main reasons:
    * I'd planned on finishing personal training by some time in 2022 but the Covid-19 pandemic forced me to close
    * A new challenge! I enjoy pushing myself and learning new things; software development offered me a terrific challenge and I look forward to continually learning more in this field
    * The fact that writing code for useful projects can, in ways both big and small, be a way to help people is very appealing to me
    * I'd love to work as part of an interesting and diverse team of people. It'd be a refreshing change after working alone for the best part of a decade

### My most recent projet:

Overreach - a project done for my Code Institute diploma. It is for users to track workouts and see other users' workouts, profiles and keep tabs on key training metrics.

The app is built in Django and is something I'm keen to keep developing because building it was such a good learning experience.

Here's the deployed app - [Overreach](https://overreach.herokuapp.com/)

And here's the repo - [Overreach repo](https://github.com/allyporwal/overreach-django)

You can log in on the deployed app and have a look around, log some workouts and see some other test user data with the following credentials:
